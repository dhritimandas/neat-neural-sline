TRAINING IMPROVEMENTS TO IMPLEMENT
==================================================

Increase Win Bonus and Game Score Impact
Priority: CRITICAL
File: train_neat.py (Line 227)
Change:
  FROM: shaped_reward = float(rew) * 10.0
  TO:   shaped_reward = float(rew) * 25.0  # Increased from 10x to 25x
Impact: Stronger incentive to win points
--------------------------------------------------

Add Progressive Opponent Difficulty
Priority: HIGH
File: train_neat.py (Line 126)
Change:
  FROM: curriculum_level = min(1.0, 0.5 + 0.5 * (generation / 50.0))
  TO:   curriculum_level = min(1.0, 0.3 + 0.7 * (generation / 100.0))
Impact: Slower difficulty progression for better learning
--------------------------------------------------

Increase Ball Hit Reward
Priority: CRITICAL
File: train_neat.py (Line 235)
Change:
  FROM: shaped_reward += 10.0
  TO:   shaped_reward += 25.0  # Increased from 10 to 25
Impact: Much stronger reward for hitting ball
--------------------------------------------------

Add Proximity Bonus for Near Misses
Priority: HIGH
File: train_neat.py (Line 245)
Change:
  FROM: # 2. Reward for positioning
  TO:   # Add near-miss bonus
                if last_ball_y > 0.5 and ball_y < 0.5 and abs(ball_x - player_x) < 0.25:
                    shaped_reward += 5.0  # Reward for being close even if missed
Impact: Encourages getting closer to ball
--------------------------------------------------

Add Reaction Time Bonus
Priority: MEDIUM
File: train_neat.py (Line 235)
Change:
  FROM: shaped_reward += 10.0
  TO:   shaped_reward += 10.0
                    # Extra bonus for quick reactions
                    if ball_on_our_side_timer < 3:
                        shaped_reward += 5.0
Impact: Rewards faster responses
--------------------------------------------------

Increase Population Size
Priority: MEDIUM
File: neat_config_slime.cfg (Line 5)
Change:
  FROM: pop_size                  = 500
  TO:   pop_size                  = 1000
Impact: More diversity for finding better solutions
--------------------------------------------------

Increase Hidden Nodes
Priority: LOW
File: neat_config_slime.cfg (Line 48)
Change:
  FROM: num_hidden                = 20
  TO:   num_hidden                = 30
Impact: More complex strategies possible
--------------------------------------------------
